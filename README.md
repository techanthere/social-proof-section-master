## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is first time in any project that I added media queries for 4 different screen widths, and the reason was the desktop design of this challenge was way more bigger than the other normal solutions I have done until now. So I decided to add media query for screen sizes between a mobile few and desktop view with width between 320px and 1440px.

I am at least now, totally comfortable and confident working with the CSS, grid and flexbox for creating different design patterns.
Also got some good learning curve for accessibility as well.

### Continued development

I have found putting more media queries helpful for challenges like this. This is just because if we don't adopt the design to different medium screen sizes, this can cause poor visual design on medium screens.
